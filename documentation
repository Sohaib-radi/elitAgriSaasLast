 What does "Move to Animal" mean?
When a new animal is born, you:

Track the birth info in AnimalBirth (✅ already done)

After some time (e.g. 9 months), the baby becomes part of the active herd

So you move its data into the Animal model (the real list of animals you manage daily)

💼 In Enterprise Terms
This is like promoting a newborn from the delivery room → to the main livestock system

You:

Copy the fields (number, species, parents, gender, birth date)

Set moved_to_animals = True in the birth record

Avoid double data entry

Build full lifecycle traceability 🔄

🔁 When do we trigger the move?
Two ways:

✅ Manually → via POST /api/animal/births/<id>/move-to-animal/

✅ Automatically → after 9 months (in background script or scheduled job)

👀 Real World Example
Let’s say:

You created a goat birth NB-0925

9 months passed

You now want it in the main animal list to track its future vaccinations, death, breeding, etc.

💥 You call move-to-animal/, and it appears in /animals/
